My name is Leo, and I'm very excited to work and learn more about HTML. When I took a course like this back in high school, this is something that really caught my attention. I am now a. Junior in Dominican majoring in informatics, and I feel like this course specifically will teach me a lot. I'm very excited to be here and hope for a good year.
