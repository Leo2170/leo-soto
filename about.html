      <h1 id="about-title"> Background and About: </h1>

<p id="about-p1">  The center first started becoming a strong topic in the Fall semester of 2023/2024. Courses such as Digital Forensics, Security for Networked Systems, and a few other started gaining traction.
  It didn't take long to find a lab in the Univeristy where computers would be available for students, so they could perform experiments, have meetings, etc. The goal of having this whole lab dedicated
to Cyber Studies is to inform our future leaders and help them reach their full potential. We hope students are pushed to further evolve their academic and soft skills.   </p>

        <p id="about-p3"> Cyber Study centers bring a lot of positives that aren't talked about enough. It brings hand-on experience, knowlegde, potential industry connections, and most importantly,
           cybersecurity awareness. We are designed to help students pursue their future goals and protect the future.<br> <br> In 2023, the number of data compromises in the United States stood at 3,205 cases. Meanwhile, over 353 million individuals were affected in the same year by data compromises, including data breaches, leakage, and exposure.
        Compared to 2022, that's a 78% increase in the number of reported data breach cases. </br> </br> </p>
